To see how our IRS works run the file v1.cpp
1) g++ v1.cpp
2) ./a.out

How it works?
1) We have different codes like addition.cpp
2) We also have a list of input and output for each code like addition_database.cpp
3) Now we simply compare the output produced by our test code for inputs contained in addition_database.cpp
